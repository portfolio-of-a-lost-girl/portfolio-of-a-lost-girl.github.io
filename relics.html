<div class="piece" id="lavender">
    <h2>Lavender Blueberry Matcha Latte</h2>
    <p>
I sit on a bench outside Target. Sipping slowly and intentionally, I taste the richness of blueberry, a hint of oat milk, and the bitterness of lavender. The cold ice refreshes my lips and the matcha makes me jolt upright ever so slightly. What does it mean to live on the edge of your eyes? You walk down the street and you see people with eyes that look as if there is 6 inches of space between what they see and who they are. I look down at the green milky foam. I sip. This sip has a stronger aftertaste of lavender, and more matcha. I sip again, experiencing only one of possibly thousands or even millions of different permutations of the ingredients. There are multitudes in just this one drink. Why is it that I never pay attention to the galaxy in each sip. I’ll only remember the way the drink tasted. But it’s only ever a construct and summation of all the separate sips, so how do I turn that into an experience? How is the sum of the parts greater than the whole?
</p>

<!-- PIECE 2 -->
<div class="piece" id="disappearing">
    <h2>Disappearing Act</h2>
    <p>I have never felt the urge to disappear in my life. It was always about standing out and being different and being noticed. But dealing with men like this. They just all make me want to disappear and be forgotten about. Why do I want to disappear? Yet equally well be seen for who I am. I want to disappear from the men who have never seen me as anything interesting. I will never be the girl anyone buys flowers for. When I pass by, I make eye contact and it is always lust I see in their eyes. When Roberto told me he forgot about his first kiss, I knew I wanted him to forget me too– which was oddly why I was ok losing my virginity to him. I will never be the girl who has eyes full of romantic love. There will never be a person who wants to love me. I stopped caring about making them remember me, I haven’t even consciously thought of trying to make myself memorable to a guy. Rohan was the cruel way that the universe wanted to show me that I could never be enough for anyone. Everyone’s got their life and their pain, and I am not allowed to be part of it. I can only bang on the glass from the outside. Try as I might, the glass will never shatter. These hands that touch my body have stolen enough from me. Maybe I’ve reached the point of being so jaded that I push away anything real. 

And now it seems like, at every turn, every man I interact with is not interested in me because they already have someone. Here I am. Pushed aside, and miffed, at every chance I try to seize. I sit here alone. Doomed to know that I will only ever experience love for the world, never love for someone. I want to let go of hope, let go of belief, let go of puzzling my way through the universe. 

I’ll never feel anything if a guy twirls me around in star market. It’ll just be another first, stolen by someone who I’ll never remember. I wish no one had touched me in the first place. I won’t find a relationship in my life–the one and only chance I had was Dao, and I screwed that up. I know I was only 15, but the pain I caused her outlives the excuse of my youth. I feel like every second I am one second away from plunging off a cliff into the void within me. He was right wasn’t he? There is a huge void in me, and I don’t even know how to deal with it. Every moment I am on the verge of bursting into tears. There's only so much love you can give yourself before it becomes boring. 

    </p>

    <!-- PIECE 3 -->
<div class="piece" id="old">
    <h2>Old Soul</h2>
    <p>I go on side quests, and make friends with adults. An “old soul” is what Nancy calls me. Nancy is my friend, a mid-aged dean at my college. I befriended Raven’s parents, so much so, that before I left, her stepdad told me I was really well spoken and should continue on my path. I provided a “really thoughtful insight” about the world to my mother’s friend Yvonne over lunch together. My physics teacher once told me that the letter of recommendation she wrote for me was the best one she wrote that entire year. My English teacher still talks about the dedication I put in for her class, and I haven’t been in her class for over 2 years. I make a mark on these adults, but I struggle more with people my age. Adults respect me for my thoughts, and those thoughts go over my peer’s heads. They don’t find that part of me captivating, yet, that’s the part adults gravitate towards. I’ve always had good relationships with those who are my mentors. Perhaps it’s an instinct in me to please. They see me as raw and authentic about who I am. Even though I may be a bit precocious, they don’t see it that way. They've all been so open minded about the knowledge I have to share. They don’t put me down for being a young kid, or invalidate my experiences because they number far fewer than theirs. It’s just always worked for me, and the ones I feel like I have real connections with are the adults. But what do I do when I am the adult? When my soul matches my actual age? Then what.

    <!-- PIECE 4 -->
<div class="piece" id="low">
    <h2>Low Maintenance</h2>
    <p>I always prided myself on being a girl who never really needed anything. I didn’t need flowers to feel special, makeup to feel pretty, or a man to feel loveable. I thought that by being someone who consumed nothing yet provided everything I would gain the hearts of everyone. I mean who doesn’t want a person to boss around and answer your every call? I could be that; I could put my needs subservient to others. I always told myself that whenever I got into a relationship, I wouldn't be one of those girls that demands her boyfriend do everything, be bitchy and ask for a lot. I would just love my man with my whole heart. Maybe that comes from my need to please my father. A+ here and A- there. I thought to keep and maintain a man, I would have to entirely devote myself, become a receptacle to be dunked in a fountain of love to be poured into his mouth to quench his thirst. I thought that’s how love worked. You showed him through repeated calling that you cared about him and were willing to look after him. But once I got to college, I got a slap on the face. Turns out you couldn’t make a man love you by getting on your knees to suck him off in the first 24 hours. I thought that being useful was my route to love. What I did in service for another would earn me the right to be loved. And then they would love me and fill my receptacle as a natural consequence. And I wouldn’t let myself be loved, I wouldn’t let them show they cared about me, I didn’t want them to have to deal with all that effort. And maybe that is an insecurity problem: I don’t feel worthy of the effort it is to be loved. So I sit and accept breadcrumbs while my heart yearns for more. 
<br><br>
And that’s changing now. I’ve gotten better at asking people for things, and accepting them when they do. I’ve put my heart and story out for a man to read and he read it and walked away. But it’s just a misalignment. And I get to experience the moments, and then leave them be as moments. I still feel like I have to prove and earn my right to love. Which is why it’s surprising when I feel like I do nothing yet still attract interest anyways. When I had sex the first time, I just didn’t have to do anything and he exacted pleasure from me. I didn’t do anything and it still made him feel good. Something about that feels wrong to me. I feel like I should have to earn his pleasure through my skill and talent, not lay down for him to take it from my body. It’s weird because I never wanted to value myself monetarily. I am worth x amount of flowers a week. I don’t want my value to be bought and paid for because I’m scared to see how others see my worth.

       <!-- PIECE 5 -->
<div class="piece" id="jaded">
    <h2>Jaded Summer</h2>
    <p>Where one chapter ends, another begins. I’m not sure which character from sex and the city I am now. But I am not who I used to be. Right as I was leaving for Florida, I got insanely horny. More so than I ever have been in a long time. I was desperate for male validation. I went on snapchat and started everyone. I would send pictures of me looking very slutty, boobs all pushed up. No nudes. Now I’ve sent snaps of my face to strangers before, and I got used to the attractive men unadding me. But not tonight. I sent every guy a very attractive boob picture. And they all just flooded me with validation. I was told by every guy that they thought I was hot and attractive. And I felt desired. I didn’t feel that same trodden path of sexualization, this time I felt empowered. I was drunk off my power, sending so many pictures to so many guys who won’t even remember my name. Every guy, every picture, validation from all of it. I even went on my snap story and added some very slutty pictures, then I had hundreds of guys trying to add me, I got my pick of the litter. I was in control, I had the power because I was desirable. Never in my life have I ever experienced anything like that. And also, one guy who seemed interested in getting to know me later on asked for more pics, and I told him no. I set the boundary. I am learning to set boundaries with men, and I think it is because I have finally taken them off their pedestal. And through my snap escapades, I found this one guy, Rohan. He seems. Well, obsessed with me. And oddly, I’m interested too. I sat on the beach in Florida looking up at the stars, but really I was looking down at our conversation. Because I don’t feel like I have to bang on the glass to prove myself to him. I can be exactly who I am. He made it very clear that he wants to take me out on dates, he doesn’t do hookups, and he was the first guy who asked if he could call <em>me</em>. It’s always been me asking if I could call guys and now he’s flipped the script. He calls himself my husband. He’s not overpromising, not talking about being in a relationship, but saying very clearly that he finds me attractive in many aspects. I’m not sure if he is chasing connection or just the feeling he gets from being with me, and whether or not he asks me a lot of questions and pays attention to the details and remembers will prove that. In some ways, his personality reminds me of Yash. Very fast and fluid and excited and puppy dog. But I do want that dominant and charismatic man too. It actually feels like it could be real. In a way that I’ve never experienced before. I can see myself with him, and it all feels possible. I don’t see a date that will be over before it begins. He gives me the interest that I think is strong and will last. But I’m worried it’ll fade like Leo. You know the whole summer I was like should I get a blender, but I didn’t. And Rohan likes smoothies and he has a blender. He is trying to fight for me, to find ways to call me, the way that I used to fight when I had less discernment. I want to have him tattooed in me. Well, he said he liked beads, and I bought him a beaded bracelet from the store. And in a cruel reminder of my fate, I woke up this morning to a text from him that says he doesn’t want a relationship. The shoe finally dropped. It hurts, and it’s been a while since I let a man hurt me. And it was with the guy who was the worst of them all because he led me on; he told me he’d take me to his place in Jersey, he told me he’d let me steal his hoodies, he even told me he wanted to go to the south of France with me and joked about getting married. Yet just like that, all my fantasies got crushed by a few texts. Yes, he was a bit hesitant when I sent him the reel about a boyfriend playing build-a-bear in VS, but really that was the only early warning sign I picked up. I asked chatGPT so many times if I was overdoing it, if I was seeing things that weren’t there. I didn’t trust my judgement, and I leaned on it to provide caution. Part of it felt too good to be true because I didn’t feel like I was waiting for the other shoe to drop, but I thought to myself: people say it is supposed to be easy when they find the right person. And now it’s odd because I tear up talking about it, but I feel so indifferent about seeing him again because I would never let him into my life again. My heart is reeling, feeling the sting of disappointment. It’s like how I can still tear up over Yash. That pain is still there. I walked to the river one night, sobbing, desperately heaving and hurting, in this deep pain because no one will ever love me. I stood on the river until midnight, when I caught a glimpse of a duck swimming alone down the river, and for some reason, watching that duck slowed me down. I couldn’t cry anymore after that. I felt my pain, and it was over. So I took myself to get taquitos, and then I sat on the train and went home. I will never find someone to give that bracelet to. He’s here in Boston now. The shoe always drops. You will always just be waiting for it to be over. There will be no happy ending for you Aryana. Your happy ending is changing the world. That is the love that you are lucky enough to experience. But no deep romantic connection. I wonder what they will feel when they see me on top of the world. I wonder if they would regret losing me– how would that make me feel?

So now I’ll wear that beaded bracelet, to remind myself to hope. From dust we came and to dust we will return. That really is a great way for me to end summer. You know, Dante is a good guy, and he doesn’t want to see girls with their ass hanging out and boobs everywhere. And maybe that’s how you win the game. But me, I can’t help it with my big boobs, I mean other than wearing baggy clothes everyday because they're obvious in everything. For me to exist is to be sexualized. And maybe that’s just me playing into it or giving up. 

The summer left me with a bad taste in my mouth for men. I’ve accepted my fate, my doom, my demise, call it what you want, but the lover girl is gone. Wrapped in jade, and disillusionment. I don’t really even think I want a relationship anymore. I want to experience what it’s like to be in love, but perhaps all I will get is the experience of being in love with life. I don’t think that love will find me because I wasn’t built for that. Fate, doom, demise, love. Love for the world, for earth, for my purpose and my career and my duty. Not for a person. I wasn’t built to be in love with anyone. The one chance I had with Dao, I shattered. And that was my one and only shot, and I guess I blew it.
