<div class="piece" id="lavender">
    <h2>Lavender Blueberry Matcha Latte</h2>
    <p>
I sit on a bench outside Target. Sipping slowly and intentionally, I taste the richness of blueberry, a hint of oat milk, and the bitterness of lavender. The cold ice refreshes my lips and the matcha makes me jolt upright ever so slightly. What does it mean to live on the edge of your eyes? You walk down the street and you see people with eyes that look as if there is 6 inches of space between what they see and who they are. I look down at the green milky foam. I sip. This sip has a stronger aftertaste of lavender, and more matcha. I sip again, experiencing only one of possibly thousands or even millions of different permutations of the ingredients. There are multitudes in just this one drink. Why is it that I never pay attention to the galaxy in each sip. I’ll only remember the way the drink tasted. But it’s only ever a construct and summation of all the separate sips, so how do I turn that into an experience? How is the sum of the parts greater than the whole?
</p>

<!-- PIECE 2 -->
<div class="piece" id="disappearing">
    <h2>Disappearing Act</h2>
    <p>I have never felt the urge to disappear in my life. It was always about standing out and being different and being noticed. But dealing with men like this. They just all make me want to disappear and be forgotten about. Why do I want to disappear? Yet equally well be seen for who I am. I want to disappear from the men who have never seen me as anything interesting. I will never be the girl anyone buys flowers for. When I pass by, I make eye contact and it is always lust I see in their eyes. When Roberto told me he forgot about his first kiss, I knew I wanted him to forget me too– which was oddly why I was ok losing my virginity to him. I will never be the girl who has eyes full of romantic love. There will never be a person who wants to love me. I stopped caring about making them remember me, I haven’t even consciously thought of trying to make myself memorable to a guy. Rohan was the cruel way that the universe wanted to show me that I could never be enough for anyone. Everyone’s got their life and their pain, and I am not allowed to be part of it. I can only bang on the glass from the outside. Try as I might, the glass will never shatter. These hands that touch my body have stolen enough from me. Maybe I’ve reached the point of being so jaded that I push away anything real. 

And now it seems like, at every turn, every man I interact with is not interested in me because they already have someone. Here I am. Pushed aside, and miffed, at every chance I try to seize. I sit here alone. Doomed to know that I will only ever experience love for the world, never love for someone. I want to let go of hope, let go of belief, let go of puzzling my way through the universe. 

I’ll never feel anything if a guy twirls me around in star market. It’ll just be another first, stolen by someone who I’ll never remember. I wish no one had touched me in the first place. I won’t find a relationship in my life–the one and only chance I had was Dao, and I screwed that up. I know I was only 15, but the pain I caused her outlives the excuse of my youth. I feel like every second I am one second away from plunging off a cliff into the void within me. He was right wasn’t he? There is a huge void in me, and I don’t even know how to deal with it. Every moment I am on the verge of bursting into tears. There's only so much love you can give yourself before it becomes boring. 

    </p>

    <!-- PIECE 3 -->
<div class="piece" id="old">
    <h2>Old Soul</h2>
    <p>I go on side quests, and make friends with adults. An “old soul” is what Nancy calls me. Nancy is my friend, a mid-aged dean at my college. I befriended Raven’s parents, so much so, that before I left, her stepdad told me I was really well spoken and should continue on my path. I provided a “really thoughtful insight” about the world to my mother’s friend Yvonne over lunch together. My physics teacher once told me that the letter of recommendation she wrote for me was the best one she wrote that entire year. My English teacher still talks about the dedication I put in for her class, and I haven’t been in her class for over 2 years. I make a mark on these adults, but I struggle more with people my age. Adults respect me for my thoughts, and those thoughts go over my peer’s heads. They don’t find that part of me captivating, yet, that’s the part adults gravitate towards. I’ve always had good relationships with those who are my mentors. Perhaps it’s an instinct in me to please. They see me as raw and authentic about who I am. Even though I may be a bit precocious, they don’t see it that way. They've all been so open minded about the knowledge I have to share. They don’t put me down for being a young kid, or invalidate my experiences because they number far fewer than theirs. It’s just always worked for me, and the ones I feel like I have real connections with are the adults. But what do I do when I am the adult? When my soul matches my actual age? Then what. 
    </p>
</div>

    <!-- PIECE 4 -->
<div class="piece" id="low">
    <h2>Low Maintenance</h2>
    <p>I always prided myself on being a girl who never really needed anything. I didn’t need flowers to feel special, makeup to feel pretty, or a man to feel loveable. I thought that by being someone who consumed nothing yet provided everything I would gain the hearts of everyone. I mean who doesn’t want a person to boss around and answer your every call? I could be that; I could put my needs subservient to others. I always told myself that whenever I got into a relationship, I wouldn't be one of those girls that demands her boyfriend do everything, be bitchy and ask for a lot. I would just love my man with my whole heart. Maybe that comes from my need to please my father. A+ here and A- there. I thought to keep and maintain a man, I would have to entirely devote myself, become a receptacle to be dunked in a fountain of love to be poured into his mouth to quench his thirst. I thought that’s how love worked. You showed him through repeated calling that you cared about him and were willing to look after him. But once I got to college, I got a slap on the face. Turns out you couldn’t make a man love you by getting on your knees to suck him off in the first 24 hours. I thought that being useful was my route to love. What I did in service for another would earn me the right to be loved. And then they would love me and fill my receptacle as a natural consequence. And I wouldn’t let myself be loved, I wouldn’t let them show they cared about me, I didn’t want them to have to deal with all that effort. And maybe that is an insecurity problem: I don’t feel worthy of the effort it is to be loved. So I sit and accept breadcrumbs while my heart yearns for more. 
<br><br>
And that’s changing now. I’ve gotten better at asking people for things, and accepting them when they do. I’ve put my heart and story out for a man to read and he read it and walked away. But it’s just a misalignment. And I get to experience the moments, and then leave them be as moments. I still feel like I have to prove and earn my right to love. Which is why it’s surprising when I feel like I do nothing yet still attract interest anyways. When I had sex the first time, I just didn’t have to do anything and he exacted pleasure from me. I didn’t do anything and it still made him feel good. Something about that feels wrong to me. I feel like I should have to earn his pleasure through my skill and talent, not lay down for him to take it from my body. It’s weird because I never wanted to value myself monetarily. I am worth x amount of flowers a week. I don’t want my value to be bought and paid for because I’m scared to see how others see my worth.

       <!-- PIECE 5 -->
<div class="piece" id="jaded">
    <h2>Jaded Summer</h2>
    <p>Where one chapter ends, another begins. I’m not sure which character from sex and the city I am now. But I am not who I used to be. Right as I was leaving for Florida, I got insanely horny. More so than I ever have been in a long time. I was desperate for male validation. I went on snapchat and started everyone. I would send pictures of me looking very slutty, boobs all pushed up. No nudes. Now I’ve sent snaps of my face to strangers before, and I got used to the attractive men unadding me. But not tonight. I sent every guy a very attractive boob picture. And they all just flooded me with validation. I was told by every guy that they thought I was hot and attractive. And I felt desired. I didn’t feel that same trodden path of sexualization, this time I felt empowered. I was drunk off my power, sending so many pictures to so many guys who won’t even remember my name. Every guy, every picture, validation from all of it. I even went on my snap story and added some very slutty pictures, then I had hundreds of guys trying to add me, I got my pick of the litter. I was in control, I had the power because I was desirable. Never in my life have I ever experienced anything like that. And also, one guy who seemed interested in getting to know me later on asked for more pics, and I told him no. I set the boundary. I am learning to set boundaries with men, and I think it is because I have finally taken them off their pedestal. And through my snap escapades, I found this one guy, Rohan. He seems. Well, obsessed with me. And oddly, I’m interested too. I sat on the beach in Florida looking up at the stars, but really I was looking down at our conversation. Because I don’t feel like I have to bang on the glass to prove myself to him. I can be exactly who I am. He made it very clear that he wants to take me out on dates, he doesn’t do hookups, and he was the first guy who asked if he could call <em>me</em>. It’s always been me asking if I could call guys and now he’s flipped the script. He calls himself my husband. He’s not overpromising, not talking about being in a relationship, but saying very clearly that he finds me attractive in many aspects. I’m not sure if he is chasing connection or just the feeling he gets from being with me, and whether or not he asks me a lot of questions and pays attention to the details and remembers will prove that. In some ways, his personality reminds me of Yash. Very fast and fluid and excited and puppy dog. But I do want that dominant and charismatic man too. It actually feels like it could be real. In a way that I’ve never experienced before. I can see myself with him, and it all feels possible. I don’t see a date that will be over before it begins. He gives me the interest that I think is strong and will last. But I’m worried it’ll fade like Leo. You know the whole summer I was like should I get a blender, but I didn’t. And Rohan likes smoothies and he has a blender. He is trying to fight for me, to find ways to call me, the way that I used to fight when I had less discernment. I want to have him tattooed in me. Well, he said he liked beads, and I bought him a beaded bracelet from the store. And in a cruel reminder of my fate, I woke up this morning to a text from him that says he doesn’t want a relationship. The shoe finally dropped. It hurts, and it’s been a while since I let a man hurt me. And it was with the guy who was the worst of them all because he led me on; he told me he’d take me to his place in Jersey, he told me he’d let me steal his hoodies, he even told me he wanted to go to the south of France with me and joked about getting married. Yet just like that, all my fantasies got crushed by a few texts. Yes, he was a bit hesitant when I sent him the reel about a boyfriend playing build-a-bear in VS, but really that was the only early warning sign I picked up. I asked chatGPT so many times if I was overdoing it, if I was seeing things that weren’t there. I didn’t trust my judgement, and I leaned on it to provide caution. Part of it felt too good to be true because I didn’t feel like I was waiting for the other shoe to drop, but I thought to myself: people say it is supposed to be easy when they find the right person. And now it’s odd because I tear up talking about it, but I feel so indifferent about seeing him again because I would never let him into my life again. My heart is reeling, feeling the sting of disappointment. It’s like how I can still tear up over Yash. That pain is still there. I walked to the river one night, sobbing, desperately heaving and hurting, in this deep pain because no one will ever love me. I stood on the river until midnight, when I caught a glimpse of a duck swimming alone down the river, and for some reason, watching that duck slowed me down. I couldn’t cry anymore after that. I felt my pain, and it was over. So I took myself to get taquitos, and then I sat on the train and went home. I will never find someone to give that bracelet to. He’s here in Boston now. The shoe always drops. You will always just be waiting for it to be over. There will be no happy ending for you Aryana. Your happy ending is changing the world. That is the love that you are lucky enough to experience. But no deep romantic connection. I wonder what they will feel when they see me on top of the world. I wonder if they would regret losing me– how would that make me feel?

So now I’ll wear that beaded bracelet, to remind myself to hope. From dust we came and to dust we will return. That really is a great way for me to end summer. You know, Dante is a good guy, and he doesn’t want to see girls with their ass hanging out and boobs everywhere. And maybe that’s how you win the game. But me, I can’t help it with my big boobs, I mean other than wearing baggy clothes everyday because they're obvious in everything. For me to exist is to be sexualized. And maybe that’s just me playing into it or giving up. 

The summer left me with a bad taste in my mouth for men. I’ve accepted my fate, my doom, my demise, call it what you want, but the lover girl is gone. Wrapped in jade, and disillusionment. I don’t really even think I want a relationship anymore. I want to experience what it’s like to be in love, but perhaps all I will get is the experience of being in love with life. I don’t think that love will find me because I wasn’t built for that. Fate, doom, demise, love. Love for the world, for earth, for my purpose and my career and my duty. Not for a person. I wasn’t built to be in love with anyone. The one chance I had with Dao, I shattered. And that was my one and only shot, and I guess I blew it.

<div class="piece" id="drinking">
    <h2>Drinking Kombucha On the Corner of Kilmarnock and Boylston St. </h2>
    <p>It was an odd morning. I felt recognizably like a past version of me. I woke up at 1am and couldn’t fall back asleep, so I stayed up. And the classic culprits to occupy my mind cycled through. A spiral- uncomfortable but familiar to me now. And I couldn’t stop it until around 5am when I decided to watch the sunrise. I also contemplated getting out of bed and just going somewhere in Boston between the hours of 1 and 5, but I didn't. I went to the banks of the Charles and let the morning air fill my mouth. I spotted a small outdoor gym. This summer I had been trying to do a pull up. The equipment gleamed with uncertainty, and I, uncertainly, grabbed an elevated bar. I began to pull. I pulled up unthinkingly and breathtakingly fast until my chin went over the bar. I screamed. That was my first pull up. I looked around, a bit embarrassed by my private moment that I had just released into the public. Alas, at 5:30am in Boston, there was no one on the Charles to scrutinize my joy. Excitedly now, I did another one. Proud of myself, I looked at the colors swimming above me. Whoever painted my view of today’s sunrise was proud of me too. Once I had released the moment, I gathered my belongings and walked down Kenmore and Fenway to get to star market. I stopped in front of the Boston University sign to sniff the red flowers, I accidentally stumbled and snapped one off. Feeling a bit like I had insulted nature herself, I put the flower on a nearby tree branch. From earth you came and to earth you will return. I paused. The sun was rising right between some buildings on the horizon and they were perfectly placed to frame the Kenmore station.  At 6am, the only people on the streets of Boston were either the homeless or self disciplined. I was neither. I uncomfortably skirted past men that appeared more comfortable staring at me than I do. Nonetheless, I had to pick up a few groceries, so I kept walking. The entrance to star market was a bit discombobulating, the fresh flowers were more vibrant than the sunrise. I walked past them all in search of lemons and potatoes. I passed a fridge and noticed a bottle that said Kombucha. Now I was a freshman in high school during the pandemic, so I knew what kombucha was. And my curiosity isn’t what I would consider disciplined. If you are curious about anything you have to be curious about everything. So I did a quick chatgpt query, and slid the cold bottle of GT synergy pomelo pink lemonade kombucha in my bag. After I paid, I stepped outside into the quiet street, and pulled open my bag. I stopped and stood. I cracked the bottle of kombucha open. It bubbled and fizzled and startled me. I burped about 3 times. Each one decreasing in wavelength. No one was there. Just me and my kombucha. And I crossed the street and went home.

    <h2>Limp Doll</h2>
    <p>Sharply, I breathe in. I already know how the train ride home will be. I can see it already. Feeling worthless is the only feeling I’ll ever get when I'm with him. Chasing the train to go see a man would sound desperate to anyone, but I’ve inured myself to the disappointment that comes after desperation, so I'll keep chasing the trains. I'll step on the tracks without looking both ways too. but only after I leave his place, never before. It doesn’t even matter which train I take because they're all the same. I'll sit on the train home feeling all the same. The train stutters or shakes and I can do little to stop my body from flopping around with it. He won’t walk me to the train stop. So before he leaves first, I’ll drag myself away– despite resentment burningly begging me not to. Rain or shine and I’ll have to go home. I’ll miss my stop because the train keeps running but what’s in me is all the same. You have to pick up and play with the doll to make her seem alive.

    <h2>Who are you? Prove it</h2>
I used to believe that my actions would speak louder than words. And they do. To people I see consistently. But to those that I see maybe once or twice, I have to sell myself. When people don’t see what you are capable of, they don’t even consider you for an opportunity they might have. The time constraint means that their opinion of me rests on what I say, not what I do. They can’t see what I do because they don’t have the time for that. When I was in an interview for iGEM. I didn’t wait to prove that I knew women’s health, I rattled off the stats I can name in my sleep. And it worked. So there has to be a balance to be had. Because right now, with Raven and Ludo, other members of the iGEM team, I repeatedly feel like I have to keep proving myself to them because we work together. I also consciously feel this push to be, I guess, productive and to prove that I’m being productive and not slacking off. Thoughts of, “I need to look like I’m working” rather than, “I need to do my work” which is maybe why I should work alone. But I can show them through my actions instead, what I do not what I say. And in a way it feels like I'm trapped in a glass box of both my own and others expectations, and I keep banging on it to prove to the outside world who I am. I never used to tell people that I came from the #1 high school in America, and now I do so people will take me seriously for my intellect. And by that I mean, men who I see only once will. Because that’s wrapped in this too, I see men for one date maybe, and I have to sell who I am so that they want to see me again in the future. You can’t be playing the long game on every date number 1, you have to sell yourself to get the prize. And the prize for them is my body, the prize for me is a moment of intimacy. Someone to let me in. 

I need to consider when interacting with people, am I going to have time to show them who I am? I mean, long term, I’m still trying to prove myself, it’s just more drawn out so it feels like there is less pressure. Yeah. I like that. 

And, part of it comes from insecurity too. That’s why I make it such a point to assert that I am a sophomore when I am surrounded by freshmen. I want people to see me even on the streets for a fleeting second and give some sort of signal that I am superior.

    <h2>Red String/h2>
You know how in detective movies the detective takes a cork board and connects pieces of evidence together with red string until it points to something big in the middle? I feel like my identity is that mess of red strings and evidence but without the something big in the middle. My string doesn’t lead anywhere. It doesn’t point to anything. It doesn’t consolidate. It doesn’t sum to anything that is greater than its parts. That's how I see myself. As pieces. Never as a whole. How can I be the book if I feel like the chapter?
It’s through strings that I am tied, chained, disconnected. It feels like every man I’m with, emotionally and physically, I become their marionette. They pull the strings and I do what they expect from me. And no one has a tighter grip on me than my father. While I was on the train to see someone, I pissed him off, and despite the fact that I live on the opposite side of the damn country, I felt those shackles pulling me off my train, switching trains, and going back to my dorm, so I could do his bidding. It’s like I was a kitten trying to escape from its litter, but I was scruffed by my neck, kicking and screaming, helpless to resist. Because every time my father gets angry, it’s on me to assuage it. My blood-born responsibility to fix it. His strings pull me most of all. And that’s why I am so complacent with men. 
<br><br>
        I am simply the daughter of an angry father, whose lashes will echo through my bones forever.
