        <h2>The idea of hope</h2>
        <p style="color: black;">
         You call me <br>
        Back <br>
        After getting drunk enough to forget <br>
        I stayed waiting <br>
        Watchful <br>
        For you <br>
        Only for you <br>
        To have forgotten the existence of me <br>
        And yet you <br>
        Call to tell me that you <br>
        Remember destroying my shelf and stealing my charger <br>
        And that I wanted you here by 9 <br>
        You remember me <br>
        When we looked at the stars and you <br>
        Only had eyes for me <br>
        But it doesn’t take root in your <br>
        Mind, only in mine <br>
        As I wait <br>
        Count the hours <br>
        To be picked up and played with <br>
        Like the doll I am for you <br>
        Take off my glasses and clean them <br>
        Why don’t you <br>
        Please clean the tears <br>
        Off my eyes <br>
        Please <br>
        Because I dread the seconds without you <br>
        I don’t even want you <br>
        To come pick me up and hold me in the mirror <br>
        As we stare at us <br>
        Because we look so good <br>
        Together–even though <br>
        At this point, <br>
        I hate myself for getting attached to you <br>
        You’re only good because you <br>
        Clawed through women <br>
        So you know us, <br>
        Me <br>
        You <br>
        Won’t make the effort to come <br>
        I got this idea in my head <br>
        This scene that plays out <br>
        When you <br>
        Come over <br>
        But don’t let me envision it because it won’t happen <br>
        You <br>
        “I’ll text you tomorrow” <br>
        No you <br>
        Won’t <br>
        It’s 8:36 and I need to stop thinking of you <br>
        Of your lies <br>
        I believed you would come <br>
        Stood by the door and begged god to let you come home to me <br>
        Hoping the hands that once carried me <br>
        Would remember I was alive <br>
        But you won’t <br>
        This lover girl has been shot in the head <br>
        Burned at the stake <br>
        Thrown into the garbage <br>
        Bruised in the heart and she <br>
        Bled all over her sleeve <br>
        Cut with insincerity inside her brain <br>
        Lies poisoned by delusion and self hatred <br>
        To believe in hope <br>
        To believe in love <br>
        To believe in you <br>
        Sleeves stiff with the blood <br>
        Of believing <br>
        The heart I used to wear so proudly is gone <br>
        You like my thoughts thighs <br>
        It was way too intimate for you <br>
        Way too intimate <br>
        As if intimacy and depth is too much <br>
        One night with you created something people live life in search of <br>
        I think about you <br>
        In the light <br>
        Even though I shouldn’t <br>
        Because you only think about me <br>
        At night <br>
        You destroyed something in me but I <br>
        Can’t give it up because you <br>
        Made me believe in an idea <br>
        The idea of hope <br>
        The idea of doom <br>
        But I suppose you are still my muse <br>
        You are only you because you know me
