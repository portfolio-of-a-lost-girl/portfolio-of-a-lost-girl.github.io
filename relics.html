<!-- PIECE 1 -->
<div class="piece" id="lavender">
    <h2>Lavender Blueberry Matcha Latte</h2>
    <p>
I sit on a bench outside Target. Sipping slowly and intentionally, I taste the richness of blueberry, a hint of oat milk, and the bitterness of lavender. The cold ice refreshes my lips and the matcha makes me jolt upright ever so slightly. What does it mean to live on the edge of your eyes? You walk down the street and you see people with eyes that look as if there is 6 inches of space between what they see and who they are. I look down at the green milky foam. I sip. This sip has a stronger aftertaste of lavender, and more matcha. I sip again, experiencing only one of possibly thousands or even millions of different permutations of the ingredients. There are multitudes in just this one drink. Why is it that I never pay attention to the galaxy in each sip. I’ll only remember the way the drink tasted. But it’s only ever a construct and summation of all the separate sips, so how do I turn that into an experience? How is the sum of the parts greater than the whole?

<!-- PIECE 2 -->
<div class="piece" id="disappearing">
    <h2>Disappearing Act</h2>
    <p>I have never felt the urge to disappear in my life. It was always about standing out and being different and being noticed. But dealing with men like this. They just all make me want to disappear and be forgotten about. Why do I want to disappear? Yet equally well be seen for who I am. I want to disappear from the men who have never seen me as anything interesting. I will never be the girl anyone buys flowers for. When I pass by, I make eye contact and it is always lust I see in their eyes. When Roberto told me he forgot about his first kiss, I knew I wanted him to forget me too– which was oddly why I was ok losing my virginity to him. I will never be the girl who has eyes full of romantic love. There will never be a person who wants to love me. I stopped caring about making them remember me, I haven’t even consciously thought of trying to make myself memorable to a guy. Rohan was the cruel way that the universe wanted to show me that I could never be enough for anyone. Everyone’s got their life and their pain, and I am not allowed to be part of it. I can only bang on the glass from the outside. Try as I might, the glass will never shatter. These hands that touch my body have stolen enough from me. Maybe I’ve reached the point of being so jaded that I push away anything real. 

And now it seems like, at every turn, every man I interact with is not interested in me because they already have someone. Here I am. Pushed aside, and miffed, at every chance I try to seize. I sit here alone. Doomed to know that I will only ever experience love for the world, never love for someone. I want to let go of hope, let go of belief, let go of puzzling my way through the universe. 

I’ll never feel anything if a guy twirls me around in star market. It’ll just be another first, stolen by someone who I’ll never remember. I wish no one had touched me in the first place. I won’t find a relationship in my life–the one and only chance I had was Dao, and I screwed that up. I know I was only 15, but the pain I caused her outlives the excuse of my youth. I feel like every second I am one second away from plunging off a cliff into the void within me. He was right wasn’t he? There is a huge void in me, and I don’t even know how to deal with it. Every moment I am on the verge of bursting into tears. There's only so much love you can give yourself before it becomes boring.
